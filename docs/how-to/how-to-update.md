# How to Update

<!-- import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'; -->

## How to Update to a newer version

- If there is a New Version of the theme released, you can be notified by `watching` the repository.
- Or by checking the Home Page. Especially when a new version of Firefox Releases.
- From there you can just follow the normal [Installation Instructions](./how-to-install.md).

- Reading the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest) is recommended (maybe even mandatory).
- It's organized in a way that tells you what you need to know.
- What's new, whats old, whats been fixed, new settings, user.js required or not.
- :warning: but user.js ALWAYS required for first time installation ;).

- If you see `new • 🟢 • Settings` or `user.js required`, you have two options:
  - A -  apply the new user.js in your Profile Folder. (easy)
  - B - or add the settings into your about:config page manually. (easy)
- `A` 🛈 will reset theme settings to their default value.
- `A` 🛈 But you can always edit the settings (true/false) inside the user.js before applying it -- or keep a copy of your own with your personal configuration.

## How to Update settings (with user.js)
🛈 This is a quick reminder of how to apply the user.js, from the installation instructions  🛈
1. After grabbing the new version of the theme.
2. Copy the new user.js file from the `chrome` folder.
3. Paste it into your Profile Folder.
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Delete the user.js file from the Profile Folder **only after** firefox is restarted.
6. Now you have the new settings.
7. Don't forget to delete the user.js file ⚠️ or your settings will be reset everytime you open firefox.

> 🛈 If this task seems tedious to you, I highly recommend using the "[Hard Way](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/wiki/How-to-Install-the-Theme#installation)" installation. It does all of this for you including updating theme files, all you have to do is open a terminal and copy/paste one line.

## How to Update settings (manually)
🛈 To add new settings manually: 🛈
1. Type `about:config` in your URL bar.
2. Type the new settings from the change-log that you want to add to your theme.
3. Then press the `+` button to enable them.
4. You can also disable the setting right away if you don't plan on using it yet.
