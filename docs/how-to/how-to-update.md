# How to Update

<!-- import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'; -->

## Staying updated

FF Ultima tries to stay always-compatible with Default Release Firefox. So if you notice anything wrong after a Firefox Update, you'll probably find a theme update already released for it too (theme is developed 2 versions ahead).

You can be notified whenever a new release drops by checking the themes [Home Page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA), or "watching" the repository.

## How to Update

You can just follow the normal [Installation Instructions](./how-to-install.md) to update the theme. It's as simple as replacing your theme files with the updated version.

But reading the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest) is always recommended (maybe even mandatory).

It's organized in a way that only tell you what you need to know:

- What's new
- Whats old
- Whats been fixed
- New settings
- user.js required or not.

As mentioned many times, the user.js is usually just a one time thing. But the release page will always let you know if it may be `required` (rarely happens) for the update. If the release page marks user.js as `recommended` it's most likely because there are `new â€¢ ðŸŸ¢ â€¢` settings. If that's the case, it's up to you whether you want to reapply the user.js or not. [Typing new settings into the about:config](/docs/how-to/how-to-update) page might be faster than reapplying the user.js.

> ðŸ›ˆ If updating seems tedious to you, I highly recommend using [gituserChrome](https://ff-ultima.github.io/docs/how-to/how-to-automate-installation#with-git-userchrome-application) to automate updates. After using it one time, your configuration is saved and restored, so updating would only require 1 press of a button.
