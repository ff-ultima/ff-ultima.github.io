# userChrome Toggle

## userChrome Companion

This is [userChrome Companion](https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion). *Instead of* relying on the **about:config** page and **user.js**, I see a future where FF Ultima could work alongside userChrome Companion. Depending on the development of`UCC and how much **easier** it is for both you and me, it can become a possibility.

## UserChrome-Toggle extension support

[userChrome toggle](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle/) allows you to switch between styles through a simple button-click or even a keyboard-shortcut. If you have more creative ways of using this extension and want to see it implemented into the theme, feel free to pull request or create an issue. We'll see if it can be done.

:::warning outdated
The theme used to integrate userchrome toggle with a vertical tabs shortcut, but this feature has been mainstreamed to Firefox via the new Sidebar button (since version 131). If anyone would like to see the userchrome toggle extension used in different ways, feel free to PR an implementation.
