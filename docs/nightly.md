# Firefox Nightly

FF Ultima supports Firefox Nightly through the `ultima.enable.nightly.config` setting. This allows you to use the same version of the theme as everyone else. Also allows me to separate/manage upstream code all in one place. Whenever new changes finally reach Default Firefox and Developer Edition, they can be rotated out of the `ultima.enable.nightly.config` setting, and into their related source file.

Using Firefox Nightly, users are already aware that a new Firefox can pop up almost every other day. The same goes for the theme when on Nightly. I personally do not use Nightly, but do make time to respond/fix bugs when I discover them. And honestly, I only ever discover them when you inform me about them via `Issues`, so much appreciated!
