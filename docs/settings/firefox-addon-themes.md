# Firefox Add On Themes

:::note
This video is a bit outdated, but the concept remains the same.
:::

By restricting FF Ultima's color schemes to a non-lw-theme state, Firefox add-on themes can be used as normal. But there is 1 specific quirk. Firefox's default appearance allows color-schemes to be very dynamic but also messy in how they apply colors to the browser. The inconsistency of an add-on themes colors can become very visible in a theme that has rounded corners/padding. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this, but there is a setting that can "attempt" to swap an add-on themes colors to correct any inconsistencies.

Use `user.theme.xtension.swap.addon.colors` to swap add-on theme colors.
