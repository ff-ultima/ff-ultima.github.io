# Auto Config

FF Ultima does not depend on autoconfig, but a foundation for it was contributed in the past.

The [.optional/](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/tree/main/.optional) folder contains the foundation for autoconfig files. AC Integration, while optional, should be as simple as moving these foundational files into the (root) chrome folder. From there you can add your personal autoconfigs.

:::note
I will not be managing the theme's compatibility with autoconfig files. I'd be happy to help in keeping your configurations somewhat stable, but only if it doesn't alter the theme for other Users. If you notice any other issues related to autoconfig, sort them out yourself or PR a solution. Thank you.
