### How to add a new setting manually

Sometimes, new versions of the theme include new settings. And sometimes, adding settings manually is much easier than reapplying the user.js for an update. To add new settings manually:

1. Type `about:config` in your URL bar.
2. Type the new setting(s) that you want to add to your theme.
3. Then press the `+` button to enable them.
4. You can also disable the setting right away if you don't plan on using it yet.

### Why add new settings manually?

When updating the theme, there might be new settings which would require you to reapply the `user.js`. But re-applying the user.js means you will also be resetting your existing settings to the FF Ultima defaults. This can be inconvenient if you've already set everything up in a specific way that's different than the defaults, and if there's only 1 or 2 new settings, adding them manually is just a lot faster.

Reading the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest) is always recommended (maybe even mandatory). It's organized in a way that only tell you what you need to know:
- What's new
- Whats old
- Whats been fixed
- New settings
- user.js required or not.

So if you ever see `user.js recommended` and `new â€¢ ðŸŸ¢ â€¢ Settings`, it's up to you whether you want to reapply the user.js or type in those settings manually to add them to your theme.
