## Before contributing

Contributing to FF Ultima can range from creation of color-schemes, to feature request, to wiki documentation, to brainstorming solutions for problems in the issues forum. This guide will focus mostly on contributing to the Wiki.

For any other questions regarding contributing, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues).

## For Documentation

A lot of the FF Ultima documentation is pulled from comments and descriptions found in the theme's source files. And images/gifs/previews from the Wiki. If you want Users to see something a specific way, feel free to make comments, previews, or even new documentation when submitting PR. The Wiki is also open to contribution via https://github.com/ff-ultima/ff-ultima.github.io.

> *Assuming that you already know the basics of forking and pulling*

Contributing to the wiki is as simple as creating a new markdown file [here](https://github.com/ff-ultima/ff-ultima.github.io/tree/main/docs), or editting the existing documents found in the docs/ folder. So if you ever see room for improvement, any and all request are welcome.

## Guidelines

1. Focus on one feature/subject/topic per pull request.
2. Todo
