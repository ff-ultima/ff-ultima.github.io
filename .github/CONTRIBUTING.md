## Before contributing

The main goal of the theme's documentation is to help users by answering questions, to show them *what to expect*, and to point them in the right directions. As a result of these goals, most of the documentation is made up of comments, descriptions, and previews (imgs, videos, etc) from the theme's source files and even from issues and discussions. As long as a topic/section is relevant to the theme, any topic/section can be documented (why not).

## What can you contribute

- Any topic/subject relavant to the theme in some way
- Any formatting recommendations (like structure of pages)
- Any section of documentation that you feel may be lacking from existing documents

## How to contribute / Guidelines

FF Ultima uses Docusaurus (fast site generator for documentation websites). Managing the website is made to be extremely simple because of it.

- Updating documentation takes place in the [`/docs/`](https://github.com/ff-ultima/ff-ultima.github.io/tree/main/docs) folder, using simple markdown files (.md).
- And previews are organized in the [`/static/img/`](https://github.com/ff-ultima/ff-ultima.github.io/tree/main/static) folder. With a 10MiB file size limit (github).

You can get a good grasp of how files are created and organized by browsing the existing md files in /docs/. Docusaurus obviously has great [guides for this too](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/create-doc). For any other task related to Docusaurus, like react elements or new pages (not documentation), please refer to their documentation. When PR, whether you're creating new markdown files or editting existing documentation simply focus on one subject/topic per pull request.
